To install these files type ./INSTALL from this directory.  The
necessary files will be copied to paramesh/mpi_source,
paramesh/source, or paramesh/Tests, as necessary.  The Makefile.gnu's
in these directories may also be modified.  You should then recompile
the package as you normally would.

The install script calles the INSTALL.py script so you will also need
python on your system.  

These files provide a support for multigrid is also described in the
user documentation.

USAGE NOTES:

There 3 routines which you will need to use to construct a multigrid
algorithm.  To use these routines you should, of course, be thougoughly
familiar with multigrid algorithms and also with PARAMESH.

The 3 routines you will need are:

	amr_mg_init()
	
	This routine initializes the multigrid and sets up data
	arrays for data exchange operations for the different levels
	in the PARAMESH tree hierarchy.



	amr_mg_restrict(nprocs, mype, level)

	This routine performs a restriction step by restricting 
	the data in the 'work' array from level to level-1.  Upon
	return the PARAMESH tree structure has been modfied such that
	tree nodes at level are no longer active and nodes at tree
	level level-1 are turned 'on' and have their nodetypes 
	changed to be equal 1 (i.e. these tree nodes become leaf
	nodes).

	amr_mg_restrict takes 3 arguments. 
	  nprocs -> the number of processors used.
	  mype   -> the calling processors
	  level  -> the tree level currently being 'visited' during 
                    a leg your multigrid algorithm


	  
	amr_mg_prolong(nprocs, mype, level)

	This routine performs a prolongation step by prolonging
	the data in the 'work' array from level-1 to level.  Upon
	return the PARAMESH tree structure has been modfied such that
	tree nodes at level become active. Nodes at tree
	level level-1 are turned have their nodetypes 
	changed to be equal 2  (i.e. these tree nodes become parents 
        of leaf nodes).

	amr_mg_prolong takes 3 arguments. 
	  nprocs -> the number of processors used.
	  mype   -> the calling processors
	  level  -> the tree level currently being 'visited' during 
                    a leg your multigrid algorithm
	  
All processors MUST CALL THESE ROUTINES synchronously (just like all
other PARAMESH routines).

A simple V-cycle can be constructed as:

	call amr_mg_init()

 	! upward leg of V cycle
	do level = lmax,2,-1 ! NOTE: lmax is the max no. of 
                             ! current levels and is not necessarily 
                             ! equal to lrefine_mas
	  call amr_mg_restrict(nprocs,mype,level)
	  ! insert your relaxation routine here
	end do

	! Solve at level = 1, the root of the tree structure

	! downward level of V cycle
	do level = 2,lmax
	  call amr_mg_prolong(nprocs,mype,level)
	  ! insert your relaxation routine here
	end do

If you have trouble using these routines and since they are being
released as an 'alpha' feature, contact Kevin Olson
(Kevin.Olson@gsfc.nasa.gov) for help in constructing your own
multigrid code.
