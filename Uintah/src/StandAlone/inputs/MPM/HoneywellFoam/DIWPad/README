This directory contains several examples of simulations of direct ink write
pads, along with some additional files to help set up those simulations,
and others to look at the data.

1.  makeDIWPad.cc is a small C++ code built for constructing CSG representations
of DIW pads.  Compile and run instructions are given inside the source file.
It is compile time configurable to generate full or quarter symmetric pads,
and to prescribe the thread diameter, spacing, overlap, etc.  It generates
outputs with some of the input information built into the file name.

2.  Several examples of output from the makeDIWPad.cc code are given, such as
DIWPad.NL10.TPL20.xml.  As the file name implies, that is 10 layers, 20 threads
per layer.  Note that makeDIWPad includes at the top of the xml files that it
generates, a comment section to indicate to the user what inputs were used
in making that file.

3. There are several corresponding examples of Uintah input files, such as
dwInclude20x20.ups, these point to the xml files that contain the geometry.

4.  These files use a prescribed piston displacement.  The piston velocity 
prescription used in recent DIW pad simulations is pistonVelDW5_1700.txt.  This
file is pointed from within the ups files.

5.  To view the types of diagnostics that are available in laboratory 
experiments, one needs to copy "process.csh" into a resultant Uintah Data
Archive directory (uda).  Note that one might need to change the file name
given in the first line of that file.  That file name, just a long number,
refers to a particle that is simply present to track the displacement of
the piston.  To use, simply do:

> ./process.csh

from within the uda, and this will generate a file called time_disp_force.dat.

6.  One can use gnuplot to plot a force displacement curve, by simply running:

> gnuplot inplotDIWPad

from within the uda as well (after copying the inplotDIWPad file inside of the 
uda).
